## Abstract
This project was an important part of my master thesis. In our society, digitization manifested an “always on” paradegima of constant accessibility and quick answers. The goal in this project was the conception of an application which contradicts the paradigm. A possible set-up was presented to motivate the reduction of online time in favor of offline time.
